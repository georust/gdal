# Changes

## Unreleased
* Added wrapper for Transformer (currently only implementing GCP Transformer)
* Added wrapper for GDALCreateAndReprojectImage
* **Breaking**: Upgrade to `ndarray 0.15`
    * <https://github.com/georust/gdal/pull/175>
* Implement wrapper for `OGR_L_TestCapability`
    * <https://github.com/georust/gdal/pull/160>
* **Breaking**: Use `DatasetOptions` to pass as `Dataset::open_ex` parameters and
    add support for extended open flags.

    ```rust
        use gdal::{ Dataset, DatasetOptions }

        let dataset = Dataset::open_ex(
            "roads.geojson",
            DatasetOptions {
                open_flags: GdalOpenFlags::GDAL_OF_UPDATE|GdalOpenFlags::GDAL_OF_VECTOR,
                ..DatasetOptions::default()
            }
        )
        .unwrap();
    ```

    `GDALAccess` values are supported usinf [`From`] implementation

    ```rust
        Dataset::open_ex(
            "roads.geojson",
            DatasetOptions {
                open_flags: GDALAccess::GA_Update.into(),
                ..DatasetOptions::default()
            },
        )
        .unwrap();
    ```

* Add more functions to SpatialRef implementation
    * <https://github.com/georust/gdal/pull/145>
* **Breaking**: Change `Feature::field` return type from
  `Result<FieldValue>` to `Result<Option<FieldValue>>`. Fields
  can be null. Before this change, if a field was null, the value
  returned was the default value for the underlying type.
  However, this made it impossible to distinguish between null
  fields and legitimate values which happen to be default value,
  for example, an Integer field that is absent (null) from a 0,
  which can be a valid value. After this change, if a field is
  null, `None` is returned, rather than the default value.

  If you happened to rely on this behavior, you can fix your code
  by explicitly choosing a default value when the field is null.
  For example, if you had this before:

  ```rust
  let str_var = feature.field("string_field")?
      .into_string()
      .unwrap();
  ```

  You could maintain the old behavior with:

  ```rust
  use gdal::vector::FieldValue;

  let str_var = feature.field("string_field")?
      .unwrap_or(FieldValue::StringValue("".into()))
      .into_string()
      .unwrap();
  ```
